See [fp07_calibration](../Code/fp07_calibration.m) for the code.

For each FP07 sensor:
- Extract all the profiles reference temperature, JAC_T on a VMP, and the FP07 data.
- For each profile take the cross correlation to find the maximum correlation and the lag between the reference temperature and the FP07 data.
- Find a weighted median lag between the sensors for the whole file.
- Shift the reference temperature in time to match the FP07 sensor.
- Do an in-situe calibration of the FP07 sensors using the reference temperature, JAC_T, over all the profiles.
- Compute the FP07 derived temperatures from the calibration and replace the T?_(slow|fast) values.
