# [diss_inspector.m](diss_inspector.m) visualize and inspect the combined dissipation estimates

[diss_inspector](diss_inspector.m)
 a visualization of the individual and averaged dissipation estimates, epsilon, from the combined dissipation estimates generated by the perturb package.

A method of getting started with 
`[diss_inspector](diss_inspector.m)`
is to run your perturb script, like 
[example0.m](../Examples/examaple0.m)
in the examples folder, then run `diss_inspector(pars=pars, xLim=datetime("2023-05-12 05:15") + minutes([-2,4]))` from within MATLAB. This will open the combined dissipation estimates from 
[example0.m](../Examples/examaple0.m)
in the diss_inspector GUI, with the x-axis limited to a 6 minute windo about the specified datetime. For your data will will either want to remove the `xLim` option or change the limits. This example is a single profile. For real data you will see many profiles. 

You will see three panels representing the average dissipation, `epsilonMean`, `e_` from shear probe 1, and `e_2` from shear probe 2. 
- You can zoom in on a depth range in any of the plots and they will all zoom into the same depth range.
- If you click on a dissipation cell, three additional figures will be opened:
 - Figure 11 are various dissipation related diagnostics for the profile.  The horizontal grey band is the depth of the selected cell
 - Figure 12 is the Kolmogorov fits for the selected dissipation estimate.
 - Figure 13 are various scalar diagnostics for the profile. The horizontal grey band is the depth of the selected cell

In addition to clicking on a cell, you can navigate using the arrow keys.
